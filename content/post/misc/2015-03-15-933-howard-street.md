933 Howard street was home before I even knew. One of the first things I did when I moved to the US was to go to there, to meet some people before Bay to Breakers. Since then my American life was bound to that address.

There I met people I have as best friends today and luckily, a couple of years later, some of them became my roommates.

There I said goodbye to great friends, that went back to their home country.

There I spent countless hours crying over the hardest breakup of my life.

There I learned so many things, from subatomic particles to welding.

There I celebrated my friends’ wedding and got mad drunk and happy.

Now it’s my turn to say goodbye to 933 Howard street. Thank you for everything!
