# call4paperz.com goes opensource

In 2010, me, Douglas Campos (qmx) and Anderson Leite worked on a RailsRumble
project called call4paperz.com. Almost 2 years later, the project is still
online and being used by a lot of people. It is definitely one of my most
successful personal projects I've ever made, and I am really proud of it.

Unfortunately, I haven't been fair to it. It has a lot of potential, but I've
only been doing some simple maintenance in this period, and I am sorry, I have
not been fair to call4paperz users. I was working on a complete rewrite
(remember, it is a RailsRumble project) and redesign, but I lost the will of
doing that. I've moved to San Francisco and a lot of new projects are queueing
in my work pipeline (one of them is finding an apartment, which is a whole job
by itself).

So, to stop being unfair to call4paperz users, now call4paperz is opensource.
I will still pay for hosting, domain and manage the Twitter account, but any
further development are now welcome. Please submit your pull request :)

The source code lives in [GitHub](https://github.com/vinibaggio/call4paperz) under MIT
license. You can also join the [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/call4paperz-dev).

I have to admit that the source code is messy and we have just a couple of
integration tests, old Rails version, cowboy style. But if you're working on
a feature and need any help, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for listening and using our product!
