Roasted broccoli, playing with plating. Notes: reduce the balsamic more, it didn’t hold its shape, too watery. Roast in phases, broccoli and cherry tomatoes didn’t caramelize, whereas the lemon did. Broccoli would have tasted much better if more crispy. Lemons need to be cut more precise, clearly can see where they cooked more.

Burger was a teeny bit overcooked, 4min then 2min maybe? Salt and pepper only, 15% fat, organic from Whole Foods. Very good!
