Here's a little recipe of something I cooked last night on an improvisation.
I'm sure it's a known recipe somewhere, but I liked it so much I wanted to
write it down. Let me know if you make it and what you think.

# Instant pot kale stew recipe

Servings: two hungry people

Time: maybe 30 minutes?

Vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free (if you want)

## Ingredients

- 1/2 lb of kale (I bought a chopped and washed kale bag because I am lazy)
- 1 tbs Olive oil
- Garlic to taste (I used two cloves)
- One or two pieces of dried porcini or dried tomatoes or both
- 4 cups of Water or stock (I used half a boullion of vegetable stock for
  4 cups of water)
- 1/2 tsp. of tomate paste.
- 1 small can of tomatoes in cubes
- Some vinegar (sherry or balsamic would probably be bomb, but I used a wine
  vinegar)
- 1 tsp. rosemary (half if using dried)
- 1 tsp. chili flakes
- Optional: 1 bay leaf
- Optional: pine nuts (for bonus points, toast it)
- Optional: some dry italian cheese like parmesan, pecorino-romano,
  whatever fancies your heart.

## Directions

Before doing anything, heat two cups of water and hydrate the porcini (or tomatoes or both). Set aside. While
the umami magic is happening, turn on the Instant Pot in sautée mode. Peel the garlic cloves. Add the oil to the pot, stir in
the garlic cloves until the wonderful smell of sizzling garlic hits you in the face.

Once that's done, put in the kale in the pot and add two cups of water/stock and stir it all. Once that's done, stir in the water with the porcini/tomatoes. Add a can of cubed tomatoes and the bay leaf. Stir it all, close the Instant Pot and set it on high for 5 minutes.

Once the 5 minutes are up, do a quick-release (I put a towel on the vapor release so I don't have vapor all under my cabinets, recipe for disaster/mold).
Open the pot, add in the pine nuts, rosemary and chili flakes. Mix it all, adjust the water content (want soupy? add more water, want less soupy? let the
keep-warm function to boil some of the water down). It's ready. Plate it on bowls, add your cheese or a fancy olive oil and maybe some grinds of black pepper.

### Suggestions to make it heartier

I actually lied to you. I didn't do the recipe the way it is. I made chicken too. In the morning of I seasoned 4 pieces of chicken thighs
with salt, pepper and tamari (gluten-free soy sauce). Instead of adding the garlic, I patted the chicken dry, put them skin side down before
turning the Instant Pot on.

Once all that beautiful fat was rendered down (watch it, it will stick a little), I flipped it. Once it's cooked thorough removed the chicken and set it aside. I added it back to the pot before closing the lid (don't do that, big mistake) and ate it with the stew after everything was ready.

If you're keeping vegetarian/vegan, I can also see someone adding a can of cannellini beans to this I am sure it would be great.
