I am Vin√≠cius Baggio Fuentes, a brazilian living in the United States. I spend most of my time writing software for companies (in the past I worked for companies like DigitalOcean, Medium, Pivotal Labs and PlataformaTec).

While I am not busy with my employer's work, I try to spend my time photographing, listening/learning/playing music and cooking. I suck at all of these skills.

You may notice that my blog is bilingual. I write in whatever language I feel like it so I apologize for the inconsistency.

Here's how I looked like sometime in 2018:
